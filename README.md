Controlls:

F1: Randomize grid, live chance 0-100 <br />
F2: Standard Relative Neighborhood Graph  <br />
F3: Relative Neighborhood Graph that adds circles of chosen size at nodes  <br />
F4: Generate random cells in proximity to other cells of type  <br />
F5: Cellular Automata with chosen live cell rule  <br />
F6: Cellular Automata with option to use neighbors at distance 2 instead of 1  <br />
